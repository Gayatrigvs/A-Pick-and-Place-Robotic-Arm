# A-Pick-and-Place-Robotic-Arm
A Wi-Fi controlled pick and place robotic arm is designed with the help of WebSockets.  It has 3 degrees of Freedom. 
A.	Tools and Components:
The tools and components being used for the project are as follows:
1)Node MCU
2)Arduino IDE
3)Servo Motors
4)Jumper Wires
5) ESP32
6) ESP 8266
7)Android Studio
8)Kotlin

B.  Block Diagram
A block diagram or flowchart is shown in the following Figure. (fig.1) The project has been started by studying various research papers and doing some study work. The prototyping is done for the same just like the model. Assembling the elements and making of the circuit is another level which is then followed by the coding and software part in Arduino IDE. Lastly, testing and removing the errors and bugs if any from the model and code as well was the other part. The last and least process was to make an app which can control the robotic arm.

Web socketing is done with the help of ESP 32 and ESP 8266. For the betterment of the user, a mobile app has been developed to control the robotic arm actions. The app has been developed with the help of android studio. User Interface has been developed a little to make it more user friendly and precise. The whole set up has been done then.
A fully designed Robotic arm can perform several pick and place actions. The mobile app developed so far is able to control the actions and gestures of the robotic arm. The app has several features. The app has several screens. The first one is the Home Screen where the user has to enter the IP address and port number of the given wifi connection. Next the user will be directed to the main page after getting connected to the wifi successfully. The main page has three buttons each for adjusting the servo position. The app can adjust the Robotic arm actions.
